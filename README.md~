[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/Fooda/SnapPea/badge.png?branch=correct_tests)](https://coveralls.io/r/Fooda/SnapPea?branch=correct_tests)
## Development Setup
*Note: We are running OS X 10.8.4 on Airs. I've seen it run on Windows and CentOS but I can't promise these instructions will work there*

On a fresh machine, you'll need SnapPea basics:
 - [Mac Dev Tools](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/).
 - [ruby-1.9.3-p394](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)
 - [rails 3.2.12](http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html)
 - [Don't use railsinstaler.org on a Mac but I've heard it will work on Windows.](http://railsinstaller.org/)
 - Install the heroku [tool belt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) & [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)

### Databases

#### Redis
We only use redis for [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq). We do not persist anything to it or use it as a cache.

```bash
# Install
$ brew install redis
# Run
$ redis-server
```

###### Trouble Shooting
```bash
# Permission issues? try:
$ sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/var/
```
*Careful*: If redis-server or any sidekiq workers are running, they can cache your rails environment even if you restart your rails server. You have to shut down the redis-server, restart the workers and restart the rails server to get a fresh copy of your source. :(

#### Memcached
```bash
# Install
$ brew install memcached
# Run
$ memcached -vv
```

#### Postgres
We use postgres as our relation database for all persistence. 
[General install notes:](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac-with-homebrew-and-lunchy/)
 - Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and edit with the settings for your machine.
 - We have a postgresql user named `admin` but you can use whatever you'd like as long as you have one.

```bash
$ psql -d postgres
postgres=# create role admin with createdb login password 'password';'
```
- start and stop with lunchy `$ lunchy start postgres` or add it to your .bashrc
- We have a lot of required data in the system. `rake db:seed` will set you up but a production snapshot is best.

#### ElasticSearch
We use ElasticSearch to maintain the indexes for Event and SelectEvent, which we use for search and display purposes throughout the application. 

```bash
$ brew install elasticsearch
$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
```
Once installed, it will be running on http://localhost:9200, which you will have to specify for your environment with config/application.yml:

```bash
ELASTICSEARCH_URL: http://localhost:9200
```
After installing ElasticSearch, you will need to create the index for both SelectEvent and Event:

```bash
$ rake elasticsearch:create_indexes
```

### 3rd Party Services
- Sign up for a [Braintree Sandbox](https://www.braintreepayments.com/get-started) and add the credentials to you development application.yml
- verify the AWS s3 bucket

### Source
General:
- You'll need [catering](https://github.com/Fooda/catering) for the public catering site to sit in the same directory as SnapPea. Adjust the Gemfile accordingly.

Contractors: 
- Fork the project
- `clone` your repo and plan on pull request for code reviews
- If we don't tell you a branch to pull request into, please ask us first.

Foodizens Techs:
- 'clone` this project. Don't fork. 
- Plan on pull requests for code review.

#### Setup
- Set a bash environment for your Rails env in ~/.bashrc: `RAILS_ENV=DEVELOPMENT`
- Copy config/application.yml.example to config/application.yml accordingly
- Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml accordingly


***

### Run

```bash
$ bundle install

# Setup your postgresql (make sure it's running before)
# From Scratch
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:schema:dump
$ rake db:test:prepare
$ rake db:seed

# Or with a db dump
$ pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U [USER NAME] -d snappea_core [PG DUMP NAME]


# Two ways to start the web server (finally...):

# 1. For the full heroku web environment
# Check out the Procfile (in app root) for the processes & jobs that foreman starts.
$ foreman start

## OR ##

# 2. If you don't need redis/sidekiq you can just start the server:
$ rails s
```

Catering is nested as a subdomain. Since localhost:3000 won't support subdomain you have to access it at:  `catering.lvh.me:3000`
